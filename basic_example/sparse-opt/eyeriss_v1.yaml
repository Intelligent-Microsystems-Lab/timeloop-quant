# eyeriss v1 optimization features
#  - DRAM compression for Inputs and Weights
#  - gating on weights scratchpad
#  - note that the bitmask metadata associated with the ifmap scratchpad is not here because the metadata did not
#    allow ifmap accesses to be saved, which is what conventionally what metadata will help to achieve, so we model
#    it as an extra bit in the datawidth instead of as a metadata
